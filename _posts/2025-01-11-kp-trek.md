### Day 0: Journey to the basecamp from Rishikesh
Ah, early morning travel - one of the most tiring events in my life. This trip was no different. With hardly any sleep, I got up early to meet the team and catch the travel bus. With a half-drowsy mood, I almost got the wrong bus. Thankfully, I found the right one and met half of the team in one of the bus. As we settled, we started introducing ourselves. The bus got delayed by an hour waiting for other people to reach. After the brief wait, we got moving.

Cursed with motion sickness, I took over the front seat. The bus journey was quiet for the first few hours. Laterd, the group got active and started to play some weird games that didn't catch my interest. After being forced to take part, I reluctantly started to participate. Dancing and singing aren't exactly my cup of tea, so I firmly avoided participating. It was pretty clear that others didn't vibe with my behavior. It was also clear that I won't be a good company.

On a more positive note, I enjoyed sending updates and photos to my new friend and my sister.

When we reached the basecamp, sheer exhaustion made socializing even harder. The speech from the trek leader about being one family didn't resonate well either. We ended the day with a nice dinner followed by an update on the itinerary.
