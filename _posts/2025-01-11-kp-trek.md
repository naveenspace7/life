### Day 0: Journey to the basecamp from Rishikesh
Oh the travel during early mornings, one of the most tiring events in my life. This was no different - with hardly any sleep, I got up to meet the team to catch the travel bus. With a half drowsy mood, I almost got into the wrong bus. After finding the right bus and meeting half of the team in one of the bus, we started introducing each other. However, the bus got delayed by an hour because of another delayed bus. After the brief wait, we got started in the bus.

Blessed with motion sickness, I took over the front seat. The bus journey went quiet for a few hours. Later, when the group got active and started to play some weird games that didn't catch my interest. After being forced to take part, I reluctantly started to take part. But dancing and singing not being part of interest and strongly opposed participating. It was pretty clear that others didn't vibe with my behavior. It was also clear that I won't be a good company.

On a more positive note, I loved sending updates and photos to my new friend and my sister.

After reaching the basecamp, the sheer exhaustion didn't help with the socialization. The speech from the trek leader about being one family didn't catch my interest either. Finished the day with a nice dinner followed by an update on the itinerary.
